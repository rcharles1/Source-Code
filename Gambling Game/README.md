This is web application that offers interactive but simple gambling experience by simulating tossing of a coin and throwing of a six-sided die.

The gameplay( the game's description) is as follows;
Upon entering the game, players are required to make payment of at least two million shillings. The game begins with the player tossing a virtual coin. 
If the landing side is head, the player proceeds with throwing a dice and wins the equivalent of the landing side in millions then the game is over. 
If the landing side is tails, a player gets three more trials.

The web application's design was created using Figma. Please click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/q4qg5xNBrMEHDsbYIiJjLj?type=design) to view the design in Figma.
