W-Print is an application designed for Android devices. Its primary function is to streamline the printing process by removing the necessity for 
additional devices(external peripherals). This application enables users to print directly from their smartphones to printers that are connected
to Wi-Fi or the internet. An added advantage of this direct printing capability is that it reduces the risk of virus infections that could potentially
occur when using external peripherals. 
This makes W-Print a convenient and safer alternative for mobile printing needs.

The applicationâ€™s user interface (UI) was designed using Figma. Click [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/9SyNtgc0E3i959T2DQjNHk?type=design) to see the UI design in Figma.

Additionally, W-Print incorporates a mobile money payment feature, providing a convenient way for users to manage printing costs.
