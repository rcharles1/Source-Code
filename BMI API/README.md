This is a RESTful API developed using Flask, it is designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). The API accepts user-provided parameters for weight and height, 
computes the BMI, and returns the calculated BMI value.

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the API, I conducted rigorous testing using Postman. 

In addition to the BMI value, the API also provides a health status description that corresponds to the calculated BMI, 
offering users a comprehensive understanding of their health metrics. 
This feature enhances the user experience by providing meaningful context to the raw BMI number.
